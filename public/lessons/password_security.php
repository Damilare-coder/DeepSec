    <h1>Password Security</h1>
    <p>In this lesson, we will cover the importance of password security and best practices for creating and managing passwords.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Password Security Matters</h2>
    <p>Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts. Weak passwords can lead to data breaches and identity theft.</p>
    
    <h2>Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use at least 12 characters, including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
        <li>Avoid using easily guessable information, such as birthdays or common words.</li>
        <li>Consider using a passphrase made up of random words.</li>
        <li>Change your passwords regularly and avoid reusing them across different accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Using Password Managers</h2>
    <p>Password managers can help you generate and store complex passwords securely. They can also autofill your passwords on websites, making it easier to maintain strong security.</p>
